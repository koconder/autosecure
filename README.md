# Autosecure Bad-IP Blocking ##
A shell script that grabs a number of spam block-lists such as [Spamhaus DROP & EDROP Lists](https://www.spamhaus.org/drop/), [DSheild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DShield), and [Abuse.ch Free Hosts and Bad IPs](https://zeustracker.abuse.ch/blocklist.php) and adds them to `iptables` to cut down on spam and other malicious activity.
